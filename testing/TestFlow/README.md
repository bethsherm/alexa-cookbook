## TestFlow <a id="title"></a>

Are you developing a conversational skill?  Maybe you are building a game, or a questionnaire, that requires several steps.
You have probably seen how session attributes are set and get to allow the skill to remember things and keep track of the state of the skill.
Sometimes it is difficult to visualize how your skill behaves as a "state machine" through many sequences of events.
It can get tedious to verbally test a skill with several steps.

In the main [testing](../testing) folder, we see several examples of how to test your code with one specific, discrete event.
This is useful if you have a specific test state you need to reproduce and debug.

A skill may prompt the user for inputs early in the conversation, store the responses in session attributes, and use the values to look up data or perform an action.
Game skills will keep track of user names, current scores, high scores, etc.
As a developer, in order to visualize the state of session attributes throughout a long skill session, it helps to be able to run a pre-defined sequence of events and observe everthing that is happening at each point.
It is also very useful if you can override the unit test with a custom response, for example to test a multiple-choice quiz game where the correct answer depends on a random question.

This tutorial will show you an easy way to define, run, and view test sequences against your skill code from your local command line.

**```testflow.js```** is a Javascript script designed to be run from the command line.  The script will access two other files:
 * Your ```src/index.js``` skill source code
 * A dialog sequence file, such as  ```dialogs/staterequest.txt```


#### Dialog Sequence File
Define a text file with your skill's input events.
Put one Request or Intent per line.  This corresponds to each of the Intent requests your code expects to receive from the Alexa service.

For example: *dialogs/default.txt*

```
LaunchRequest
AMAZON.HelpIntent
AMAZON.StopIntent
```

Another example: *dialogs/staterequest.txt*

```
LaunchRequest
StateRequestIntent usstate=Vermont
StateRequestIntent usstate=New%20York
ISeeIntent animal=bear color=brown
# AMAZON.HelpIntent
AMAZON.StopIntent
MyNameIsIntent myName=
MyNameIsIntent myName=Madeline
? StateRequestIntent usstate=Texas
RecapIntent
AMAZON.StopIntent
```

 * Notice that slot values with spaces need to be encoded.  Just insert ```%20``` to replace any white spaces, such as in ```usstate=New%20York```
 * You can prompt the user to confirm, or type in, a slot value by adding a leading ```? ``` to your Intent
 * You can comment out a line with a pound #

#### Running the test

1. Open a Terminal prompt (DOS prompt, or cmd.exe in Windows).
1. Change directory to the folder: ```alexa-cookbook/testing/TestFlow```
1. Type ```node testflow```
  + You should see requests and responses for each of the default Request types
1. Type ```node testflow staterequest.txt```
  + You should see request and Intents, slot values, session attributes, and output speech.

#### Customizing the output
At the top of the ```testflow.js``` file, notice a set of options you can define.
You may change any of these to ```true``` or ```false```.

```javascript
// Toggle on or off various debugging outputs
const options = {
    speechOutput : true,  // the cyan text you hear the Echo say
    slots        : true,  // key/value pairs shown in blue and green
    attributes   : true,  // session.attributes shown in magenta.  You can also name one particular attribute to watch instead of the boolean
    stdout       : false  // console.log() messages or errors, shown in white
    requestEvent : false, // the full request JSON sent to your code
    reprompt     : false, // show the reprompt below the speechOutput
    delay        : 1.0    // delay N seconds between requests
};
```
#### AWS Calls
If your code makes calls to AWS Services such as S3 or IOT, you should be able to test these from your local command prompt, too.
Be sure you have the AWS CLI (command line interface) [installed](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) and [configured](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/Tx1UE9W1NQ0GYII/publishing-your-skill-code-to-lambda-via-the-command-line-interface).

**Note:** the ```alexa-sdk``` feature to automatically persist session attributes to a DynamoDB table has not been successfully tested with TestFlow.

``` //alexa.dynamoDBTableName = 'YourTableName';```

#### Session Attributes
Notice in magenta (purple) the session attributes that store values your skill is designed to remember.
By default, this object is empty ```{}```

Each new request uses the session attributes object from the previous session's output.
The skill code may add or modify the session attributes.  Look for any changes in the attributes after each Intent.
If your skill causes the session to end, such as when an ```AMAZON.StopIntent``` handler calls ```this.emit(':tell' )```, the session attributes will be lost.


#### Installation Steps
To try TestFlow on your own skill code, follow these steps:

1. Copy and paste the ```testflow.js``` file and ```/dialogs``` folder to your project folder, next to your ```/src``` folder.
1. Customize the settings within the top of the ```testflow.js``` file
1. Create a new dialog sequence file with your Intents in sequence, such as ```mytest.txt```
1. Run from the command line: ```node testflow mytest.txt```
